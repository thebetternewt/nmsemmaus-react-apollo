            <h2>Emmaus Sponsorship</h2>
            <p>
              Good sponsorship is vital to the integrity of Emmaus. Many
              communities take sponsorship for granted; they assume that
              everyone knows the how and why of sponsorship. Yet sponsorship is
              the most important job in Emmaus. It is more than just “signing up
              people”. The quality of sponsorship influences the pilgrim, the
              health of the Emmaus Movement, and the church affected by the
              movement.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, good sponsorship is your first act of agape before a Walk
              ever begins; the experience of the Walk for a pilgrim really
              starts with how we handle sponsorship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, good sponsorship undergirds the whole weekend with
              sacrificial love on behalf of each pilgrim. Sponsors use
              discernment in recruiting pilgrims, embody the personal commitment
              of the community to each pilgrim, and provide personal acts of
              agape during the three days for the pilgrims. These acts of agape
              include prayer, agape letters, and presence at Send off,
              Candlelight and Closing, and follow-up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Third, good sponsorship is the foundation for a healthy, effective
              Emmaus movement that is fulfilling its true purpose - the
              development of Christian leaders and the renewal of the church in
              ministry. The strength of any Emmaus community is a direct result
              of its recruiting practices. If the community is committed to
              recruiting strong church leaders for the purpose of strengthening
              the local church, then the community will be a strong, vital force
              in the renewal movement. If, on the other hand, the Walk to Emmaus
              is looked upon as a hospital where every human ill can be cured,
              it will have a weakening effect on the entire community.

            <h2>Why Do We Sponsor?</h2>
            <p>
              The aim of a sponsor should not be to “get all my friends to go”,
              to fill up the weekend, to fix people's problems, or to reproduce
              one's own religious experience in others. Rather, the aim of the
              sponsor is to bring spiritual revitalization to Christians who, in
              turn, will bring new life and vision to the work of the church in
              the congregation, home, workplace, and community. The aim of
              sponsorship is to build up the Body of Christ.
            </p>
          </Grid>

          <Grid item md={10} lg={8}>
            <h2>Whom Do We Sponsor?</h2>
            <p>
              One's awareness of, and commitment to, the purpose of Emmaus
              influences who is sponsored and how they are sponsored. Emmaus is
              for active Christians and members of churches whose own renewal
              will mean new energy, commitment, and vision in the church and
              everyday environments for Christ's sake. There are several
              qualities a prospective pilgrim should possess.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, the person should already be on a pilgrimage, willing to
              grow and move forward in their journey of faith.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, the person should have a Christian passion. The pilgrim
              knows God can make and has made a difference in their life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Third, the person isn’t so consumed by life’s circumstances that
              they are unable to give full attention to the message and
              experience of Emmaus.
            </p>
            <p>Those sponsored could include the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Church leaders (pastors and laypersons) who will bring new
                vision, commitment, and understanding back to their
                congregations and who need the renewal and grace Emmaus
                channels;
              </li>
              <li>
                Dependable church members who are the quiet backbone of the
                church;
              </li>
              <li>
                Less active members who need their awareness of grace rekindled
                and their commitments renewed;
              </li>
              <li>
                Christians who are hungry for “something more” and who want to
                grow spiritually;
              </li>
              <li>
                Respected laypersons and clergypersons whose participation,
                support, and leadership will encourage others to attend the Walk
                and will build a sound, balanced leadership base for the
                movement in the community; and
              </li>
              <li>
                Members of diverse congregations, denominations, and ethnic
                groups.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Emmaus is right for many people - but not for everyone. The
              religious background or emotional condition of some people may
              make Emmaus an improper discipleship tool for them. Others may be
              unsuitable for sponsorship because of the negative effect they
              might have on an Emmaus weekend or the divisive influence they
              might bring to the church. Sponsorship requires sensitivity to
              these factors.
            </p>
            <p>Some examples of questionable sponsorship are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Non-Christians</li>
              <li>
                Christians whose theology and/or practice is notably different
                or incompatible with the traditional theology and practice
                represented by The Walk to Emmaus;
              </li>
              <li>
                persons undergoing an emotional crisis (for example, family
                breakup, job loss, severe grief) or who are psychologically
                unstable;
              </li>
              <li>
                persons who decide not to attend a Walk after being presented
                the opportunity. A potential sponsor need not feel like a
                failure if a prospect says no. Perhaps the timing is not right.
                Perhaps God will renew the person in another way. Remember, The
                Walk to Emmaus is not the way to renewal for every Christian.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Wise sponsorship is purposeful and prayerful; unwise sponsorship
              is haphazard and undiscerning. Wise sponsorship eventually will
              produce a balanced, theologically centered movement of the Holy
              Spirit. Unwise sponsorship eventually will produce a harvest that
              becomes more of a burden than a blessing for the church.

          <Grid item md={10} lg={8}>
            <h2>How Do We Sponsor?</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Pray for the person's openness to God's call to discipleship,
                not for how to get him or her to go on a Walk.
              </li>
              <li>
                Extend an invitation. Invite the person to attend for the sake
                of a more vital relationship with Jesus Christ, not just an
                event to go to. Share your faith; explain the basic elements of
                the Walk, its purpose, and follow-up dimensions, which help us
                live in grace for the rest of our lives. Take the attitude that
                you are offering the person a wonderful gift rather than that
                they need to go.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ask the person to make a commitment by filling out the
                registration form. If the person is married, speak with both
                partners and encourage an equal commitment by both. ALL parts of
                the application must be completed and signed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Continue to pray for your prospective pilgrim. Once the pilgrim
                has been assigned to a Walk, begin to prepare agape letters. Do
                not send personal agape for the pilgrim to be delivered during
                the weekend. Pilgrims are not allowed to receive individual
                agape during the weekend.
              </li>
              <li>
                Support the Walk through your participation in the 72-Hour
                Prayer Vigil and your presence at Sendoff, Candlelight and
                Closing. Support the pilgrim's family by house-sitting,
                baby-sitting, feeding pets, watering plants, or just checking in
                with a spouse to see if any help is needed. For this reason it
                is best not to sponsor more than one pilgrim or couple at a
                time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Encourage the pilgrim in his or her Fourth Day involvement. Talk
                to them about their weekend experience. Help the pilgrim find or
                start a reunion group. Take the pilgrim to the first Gathering
                after their Walk. You could even offer to baby-sit so your
                pilgrim can attend a Candlelight.
              </li>
              <li>
                Help the pilgrim re-enter their church and consider ways to
                engage with new commitment and enthusiasm.
              </li>
              <li>
                Inform the pilgrim about ways to serve the Emmaus community on
                future Walks, creating agape and writing letters to other
                pilgrims.
              </li>
              <li>Help the pilgrim understand how to sponsor others.</li>

            <h2>Who Can Sponsor?</h2>
            <p>
              Any persons who have participated in Emmaus can sponsor another
              person to Emmaus so long as they understand the aim and
              responsibilities of sponsorship and can fulfill them for the
              person they would sponsor. Persons who have participated in
              Chrysalis can also sponsor adults to Emmaus under the same
              conditions.
            </p>
          </Grid>

          <Grid item md={10} lg={8}>
            <h2>What Should I Tell My Pilgrim?</h2>
            <p>
              While a pilgrim may not know what questions to ask, you do not
              need to tell them everything that will occur during the three
              days. However, keep in mind <strong>there are no secrets!</strong>{' '}
              Saying to a pilgrim that you can’t tell them anything about the
              Walk potentially creates unnecessary suspicion and anxiety. And
              for clergy and staff leadership, this posture builds a wall of
              division resulting in an “us vs. them” mentality against the
              Emmaus community. There is no reason to shroud the event in
              secrecy. This practice has probably done more harm to the movement
              than people realize. You can share many things about Emmaus
              without revealing some of the unique and meaningful experiences.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some suggested items to cover with a pilgrim.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                There are fifteen presentations (five each day) dealing with
                subjects like setting priorities, serving God in everyday
                situations, how to be a disciple, and how to persevere in faith.
                Encourage note taking.
              </li>
              <li>There is time spent in discussing these presentations.</li>
              <li>Time is spent in prayer and meditation.</li>
              <li>Communion is observed each day.</li>
              <li>There is plenty of good food and fellowship.</li>
              <li>
                Discuss sleeping and showering arrangements with your pilgrim. A
                list of suggested items to bring is included with the pilgrim’s
                welcome and acceptance letter.
              </li>
              <li>
                No contact with the outside world except, of course, for
                emergencies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tell how each weekend is unique, but each person seems to find
                exactly what God wants that person to experience. Don’t try to
                pre-judge what a person’s needs are or what someone will get out
                of the Walk to Emmaus. Simply tell your own story. There are no
                expected results other than experiencing God’s love.
              </li>

            <p>
              A copy of the Request for Pilgrim Reservation and the Sponsor
              Sheet can be found in the “Blue Book” given to all pilgrims and
              team members at the end of each walk. The most current copies of
              these forms can be found by clicking here.
            </p>
            <p>
              ALL parts of both forms must be completed and signed. Please
              consider each item on the Sponsor Sheet carefully and prayerfully
              consider your responsibility before signing your name. Also, make
              certain the the sponsor’s contact information on the Pilgrim
              Reservation form is accurate. Incomplete applications cannot be
              processed.
